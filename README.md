# TrelloExport
    - This script pulls information from Trello cards using the Trello.com API, formats it into a
    - spreadsheet and emails that to management, updating Trello for the next workday.

## Trello
    - In some companies, Trello is used to manage day-to-day tasks between departments.
    - In Trello, each task is represented by a Trello 'card'. Each card is organized into lists relating
    - to their current status. Everything is contained in a Trello board. A user of the board is called a
    - 'member', and each member can create, move, and modify cards amongst the lists. An example of lists for a
    - board are:

    - 'BACKLOG',
    - 'IN PROGRESS',
    - 'WAITING FOR APPROVAL',
    - 'APPROVED',
    - 'IMPLEMENTING',
    - 'COMPLETE yymmdd'

    - Where COMPLETE is followed by today's date 24hr local time formatted as yymmdd.

    - Each card contains information about it's name, when it was created, when it was last modified,
    - the current list the card belongs to, a history of 'actions' (which show who modified what
    - on the card and when), members on the card, the card description and a lot more.

## Trello API
    -Calling the API using the requests.get() function with the argument
    -'https://trello.com/1/boards/{BOARD_ID id}/cards?key={APP_KEY}&token={USER_TOKEN}' will return
    -a JSON of all the cards on the board. We can then get a python dictionary using json.loads() –
    -and a series of utility functions that look like "def get_card_name(card: dict) -> str:" – to get
    -all the card individual info.
    
## Notable Functions
    - create_spreadsheet_row() is the function responsible for creating a list of the card info.

    - create_spreadsheet_nested_list() creates a nested list, where each list of the parent list represents a row.

    - create_spreadsheet() creates a workbook and worksheet using the xlsxwriter module. It takes the nested list,
    - and iterates through the lists, writing each cell to the worksheet.

    - create_mime_message() will create the email message, and attach the excel sheet to the email

    - email_file() creates an SMTP session with the SMTP host and port, your login info, and sends the MIME message.

    - update_trello_board() will tell send a PUT request to tell the Trello API to archive the COMPLETE list,
    - then sends a POST request to create a new Trello list called COMPLETE yymmdd where yymmdd is the date of
    - the next work day (i.e. if today is Friday, March 31st, the next work day is Monday, April 3rd. So the final
    - list name is something close to 'COMPLETE 200403')
